# Closed-chains-of-polygons
Number of closed chains of identical regular polygons

## Introduction

WORK IN PROGRESS - TO BE COMPLETED SOON

We want to assemble identical regular polygons in order to build closed chains of high symmetry.

`m` is the number of vertices - meaning that we assemble `m`-polygons in a "circular" way.

A possible start is shown in Figure 1. Notice the identical angles enclosed by neighbouring polygons.

Figure 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`m = 5` Will this chain eventually close to a perfect and symmetrical chain?

The following considerations and proofs should encourage the readers of this contribution to program all possible ways for closed chains of regular polygons.

## Simple examples

The polygons have to be joined edge to edge in a "circular" way with identical angles enclosed by neighbouring polygons as suggested by figure 1.

`j` is the number of polygons in a closed chain.

Two examples of closed chains come easily to mind as they are well known from the domain of tessellations; see figure 2.

Figure 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left:&nbsp;`m = j = 6`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right:&nbsp;`m = 8`&nbsp;&nbsp;`j = 4`

## Program

Readers are encouraged to program pictures of the chains. They may draw upon the following enumeration of the chains.
