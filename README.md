# Closed-chains-of-polygons
Number of closed chains of identical regular polygons

## Introduction

WORK IN PROGRESS - TO BE COMPLETED SOON

We want to assemble identical regular polygons in order to build closed chains of high symmetry.

`m` is the number of vertices - meaning that we assemble `m`-polygons in a "circular" way.

A possible start is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`m = 5` Will this chain eventually close to a perfect and symmetrical chain?

The following considerations and proofs should encourage the readers of this contribution to program all possible ways for closed chains of regular polygons.

## Simple examples

The polygons have to be joined edge to edge in the "circular" way figure 1 suggests. Two examples of closed chains come easily to mind as they are well known from the domain of tessellations; see figure 2.
